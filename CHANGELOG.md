## [Version 0.7.0] - Unreleased

### Added
* Begin the leasing/controller redesign (see
  `dev/infer-stack-redesign-critique.md` in the aiq-eval-runner repo). New
  `infer_stack.leasing` subpackage with a backend-agnostic, sqlite-backed lease
  ledger: `acquire`/`release`/`renew` bookkeeping, demand reference-counting,
  same-model coalescing (with capacity subsumption), per-daemon coalescing for
  Ollama, soft-TTL expiry, and idle-group reclaim computation. This is the core
  that later phases (reconciler, backend protocol, `acquire`/`run` CLI) build on.

## [Version 0.0.1] -
